#testing123 <- What will this look like? Who knows! Stay tuned to find out.

Boo! I am here! In Stacy's big bad internet world! 

I can't figure out where to type the "front matter" nor "title/layout" but that's ok!! Still waiting on the guidebook :)
**UPDATE** I found your Jekyll (whatever the fuck that means) and have the front matter ready to rock. I'm basically going to use this post to figure out wtf all these commands do... stay tuned.

What are we working in here? CSS? HTML? Plain ass text?
*No? Something called Markdown? Ok dope.

I tried making something <b>bold</b> but apparently that's not what we're dealing with and command B only makes it bold for about .3 seconds

ANYWAYS, I just recieved & read your letter from The Press Hotel in Portland, ME. You are so sweet Stace :)

As practice uploading an image I am going to *attempt* post a photo of the letter, which I already know will not work because I don't know how to navigate to the assets folder. ðŸ¤· <- Do emojis work in here?

Ok well I've been fucking around in this for about an hour and my laundry is done now so I'm going to go fold it. I am excited for github class w/ Dr. Proph. Stace soon!! 

Bye :)
